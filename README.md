## Start Journey

First, setup NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable by creating your own OpenAI secrets

```bash
# Create your own .env file and put below configuration in (All set & good to go ~~)
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OWN_KEY"
# Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create your own KEY ~~
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3478](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
